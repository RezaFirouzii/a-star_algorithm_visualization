# A* path finding algorithm visualization
<h3> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">A* algorithm</a> is used to find the shortest path between 2 nodes in either a weighted or simple graph.</h3>
<h3> In fact it's based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm">Dijkstra's algorithm</a> but it also uses some heuristics in order to make a better guess about the shortest path to destination.</h3>
<h3> Here's how the visualization looks like:</h3>
